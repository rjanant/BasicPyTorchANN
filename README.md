Our goal is to develop a model capable of classifying an iris plant based on four features. This is a multi-class classification where each sample can belong to ONE of 3 classes (Iris setosa, Iris virginica or Iris versicolor). The network will have 4 input neurons (flower dimensions) and 3 output neurons (scores). Our loss function will compare the target label (ground truth) to the corresponding output score.

Steps:

1. create a multi-layer deep learning model
2. load data
3. train and validate the model
4. save and load a trained model
